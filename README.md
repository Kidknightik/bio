Hi, and welcome to my website!
My name is Matvey Anisimov, but online I go by the nickname Kidknightik. I'm 13 years old (born in 2011), and I'm a young but passionate programmer, tech enthusiast, and creator.

This website is my little corner of the internet — a place where I share who I am, what I do, and what I’ve built. Let me give you a tour!

🌌 Homepage (index.html)
Right when you land here, you'll notice a cool animated starry background that gives the site a techy, space-like feel. My homepage is simple but stylish, with a profile picture in the center and my name “Kidknightik” displayed in a bold pixel-style font. There are two big buttons:

"Osnova" — which means "base" in Russian — leads you to more about me.

"Project" — takes you to a list of some of my coding work.

Below that, you’ll find links to my Steam, GitHub, and Telegram, so feel free to connect with me there!

💻 About Me (osnova.html)
This page looks like an old-school terminal screen — because I love retro aesthetics. It tells you everything you need to know about me in a nerdy-cool way:

Who am I?
I’m Matvey, also known as Kidknightik, and I’m a programmer who already knows Python, HTML, and Java.

Where do I study?
I’m a student at the Moscow School of Programming (МШП) located in the Phystechpark in Moscow. I also take additional lessons outside of that.

What else can I do?
I can build computers, repair phones, and I even have my own server, which I use for learning, gaming, and hosting projects.

How to contact me?
All my socials are linked from the homepage — just click the Telegram or GitHub icon to reach me directly.

🛠️ Projects (project.html)
Another retro terminal-style page, this one showcases some of the projects I’ve been working on:

Lost Projects:
Sadly, many of my early projects are lost, but the experience I gained from them is not.

Python Projects:
My biggest Python project is a 2D pixel shooter game. It includes enemies, bosses, a weapon shop, and more. Think of it like a complete mini-game written from scratch.

HTML Projects:
I also make websites like this one. In fact, this is one of two personal bio sites I’ve created. I’ve also built online encyclopedias, articles, and more — all with HTML.

🎨 Visual Vibe
The entire site uses a black background with pixel-styled white text, giving it a cyber/retro-futuristic appearance. It feels both modern and nostalgic, especially with the moving starfield in the background.

The fonts are pulled from Google Fonts (Pixelify Sans), and everything is neatly responsive — it works great on mobile screens, too!

💬 Final Words
This is my world, and I’m just getting started. I’m always learning, coding, experimenting, and building. If you want to follow my journey or get in touch, check out my social links. I’m always open to new ideas, feedback, and opportunities to grow.

Thanks for visiting,
